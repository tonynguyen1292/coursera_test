# Jira Backlog Plan — WMDP2

This is the Epic → Story → Subtask breakdown for the [WMDP2 Jira project](https://tonynguyen1996jb.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WMDP2/summary), organized into sprints, aligned to what's actually in this repository (both what's already built and what's ahead).

**Live in Jira** as WMDP2-1..24 (the original import: 5 Epics, 19 Stories, 17 Subtasks) plus WMDP2-59..75 (the post-import epics and stories, added on the board as features shipped). Current board shape (see the sync logs below):
- **WMDP2 Sprint 3** (19 Jul – 2 Aug) — **completed 2026-07-20** with its whole scope Done (WMDP2-17, 65, 67); the Confluence-retrospective offer at close was declined (solo project — this file and the plan *are* the retro)
- **WMDP2 Sprint 4** — started 2026-07-23 (runs to 16 Aug) with the owner's picked scope: **WMDP2-76** (contract-test the Netlify Functions, created under WMDP2-5) and **WMDP2-20** (custom domain). **Descoped 2026-08-04, executed on the board 2026-08-09** — 13 of 25 days elapsed with zero commits against either story; both moved out rather than closing 0/2 inside it. The sprint now stands empty ("There's nothing in this sprint") and can be completed honestly. WMDP2-20 and WMDP2-76 are back in the backlog, each carrying a comment citing DISCOVERY.md's WHEN section
- **Backlog** — WMDP2-18/19 (flagged: blocked on AWS credentials) and 24 To Do; WMDP2-21, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 75 **Done** between sprints (see the sync logs); **WMDP2-74 Done** (Inspection Round — I1 shipped 2026-07-23, I2 shipped and story closed 2026-07-24; the live demo is now the playable round)
- **Unity Simulation Showcase epic (WMDP2-72, In Progress)** — the C#/Unity track, created 2026-07-22; runs parallel to web-app sprints on its own branch and capacity (2–3 h/week), never sprint-mixed by design
- The original Sprint 1/2 objects were deleted during reconciliation — the import's sprint-matching failure had left them as empty, never-started shells while their stories (WMDP2-6..16, all Done) sat outside them
- Keys 25–41 are the subtasks under stories 6–19; keys 42–58 were consumed by the import incident's duplicate subtasks (created, then deleted — see the note below), which is why the Product Polish epic starts at 59

Note on the import itself: the CSV importer's own Sprint-name matching didn't work (the sprint names in the CSV didn't match any existing sprint), and its Sub-task import ran on a slower deferred path that looked stalled but wasn't — it finished ~20 minutes later and created a duplicate, unparented copy of every subtask. That duplicate set was deleted, and Sprint assignment was done afterward via bulk-edit instead of the CSV. Worth knowing if you re-run a CSV import against this project.

## Sprint 1 — Platform Foundation (completed, for the record)

**Epic: Full-Stack Platform Foundation**
- Story: Backend API foundation — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL, `/health`, `/api/sites`, `/api/kpis`, `/api/meta/filters`
  - Subtask: Set up FastAPI app structure, config, DB session
  - Subtask: Define `Site` model and Pydantic schemas
  - Subtask: Implement filtering + KPI aggregation service layer
- Story: Database seed pipeline — port `SQL/01`–`03` cleaning rules into Python
  - Subtask: Port TRIM/INITCAP/region+LGA cleaning rules from SQL to `seed.py`
  - Subtask: Add `title`/`short_title` back into the schema for UI display
- Story: React frontend — Dashboard, Sites explorer, Site detail
  - Subtask: Dashboard page with KPI cards + breakdown charts
  - Subtask: Sites page with filter bar + paginated table
  - Subtask: Site detail page
- Story: Local dev environment — Docker Compose (Postgres + backend)

## Sprint 2 — Polish, Production Build & CI (completed)

**Epic: Production Readiness**
- Story: Loading/empty/error states across Dashboard and Sites
- Story: Responsive layout pass (mobile/tablet breakpoints)
- Story: Production Docker build — multi-stage frontend (node → nginx), `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Story: CI pipeline — backend lint (`ruff`) + compile check, frontend typecheck + build

**Epic: Multi-Select Filtering**
- Story: Backend — accept repeated query params for commodity/region/stage/site_type, filter with `IN`
- Story: Frontend — `MultiSelect` checkbox-dropdown component, wired into `FilterBar`
- Story: Seed script data validation — row-count floor, duplicate `SITE_CODE` check, post-insert count verification

## Sprint 3 — AWS Cloud Deployment (completed 2026-07-20)

> What actually finished inside the sprint: WMDP2-17 (hardening), WMDP2-65 (Related sites), WMDP2-67 (review fixes). The AWS provisioning/deploy stories (18/19) had already moved to the backlog on 2026-07-19 so the sprint carried only workable scope.

**Epic: AWS Cloud Deployment**
- Story: Harden the app for public deployment
  - Subtask: Add nginx reverse proxy for `/api`, `/health`, `/docs` (done — see `frontend/nginx.conf`)
  - Subtask: Remove backend's public port mapping in `docker-compose.prod.yml` (done)
  - Subtask: Write deployment runbook (done — `DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- Story: Provision AWS infrastructure
  - Subtask: Confirm Free Tier eligibility; set a $1 AWS Budget alert
  - Subtask: Launch EC2 instance (t2.micro/t3.micro) with a locked-down security group (22 from my IP, 80 from anywhere)
  - Subtask: Install Docker + Compose plugin on the instance
- Story: Deploy and verify
  - Subtask: Clone repo onto the instance, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`/`CORS_ORIGINS`
  - Subtask: Build and start `docker-compose.prod.yml`, seed the database
  - Subtask: Verify Dashboard, `/health`, and `/docs` are reachable at the instance's public IP
- Story: Teardown plan documented (done — `DEPLOYMENT.md` Teardown section) so nothing keeps billing after the demo

## Backlog — Future Work (not yet scheduled)

**Epic: Post-Deployment Hardening** (WMDP2-5, **Done** — auto-completed by Jira's parent automation when WMDP2-69, its last open board child, closed on 2026-07-20. Its board children are 22/23/68/69 + 21; WMDP2-20/24 were never epic-linked on the board — an import-era gap found during the 2026-07-21 sync, left for Sprint 4 planning since re-parenting open stories would reopen the epic)
- Story: TLS + custom domain (WMDP2-20) — **re-scoped 2026-07-21** (comment on the story): TLS now comes free with the live netlify.app deployment, so only the custom-domain half remains. To Do, unparented on the board
- ~~Story: Automated CD (WMDP2-21)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-21, with explanatory comment): overtaken for the production surface — Netlify rebuilds and redeploys on every push to `main`. CD to EC2 would be new scope under the AWS epic. Board parent fixed to WMDP2-5 during the sync
- ~~Story: URL-synced filters and pagination (WMDP2-22)~~ — **Done, on the board.** Shipped in the app: `/sites` (filters + page + sort) and `/map` (filters) both read/write their state to the URL query string. See [WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md) section 1.7.
- ~~Story: Automated test suite (WMDP2-23)~~ — **Done, on the board.** Backend pytest + frontend Vitest/RTL suites, both required CI steps. See WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md section 1.8 and the platform roadmap for what's still uncovered.
- Story: Path to managed infrastructure if traffic grows (WMDP2-24) — RDS instead of containerized Postgres, horizontal scaling
- ~~Story: Data-refresh guardrails (WMDP2-68)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-20). Refresh checklist, CSV formula-cell neutralization, seed-time shape warnings. See [WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md) section 1.16.
- ~~Story: Platform hygiene (WMDP2-69)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-20). Node 24 pinned across dev/CI, literal-BOM CI guard, `/api`-wide `no-store`. See section 1.17.

Also parked here from Sprint 3 (2026-07-19): **WMDP2-18 Provision AWS infrastructure** and **WMDP2-19 Deploy and verify on EC2**, both flagged in Jira as blocked on AWS credentials — the `DEPLOYMENT.md` runbook is ready to execute the moment an account is configured. Moved out of the active sprint so it only carries workable scope.

**Epic: Product Polish** (WMDP2-59, In Progress — created on the board 2026-07-19)
- ~~Story: Sortable table columns~~ — Done, on the board. See WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md section 1.5.
- ~~Story: Map view~~ — Done, on the board. See section 1.6.
- ~~Story: Command palette / global search (Ctrl/Cmd+K)~~ — Done, on the board. See section 1.9.
- ~~Story: CSV export of filtered view~~ — Done, on the board (covers the export endpoint, header labels, and no-store caching). See sections 1.10 and 1.12.
- ~~Story: Cleaned-data pipeline consolidation~~ — Done, on the board. See section 1.11.
- ~~Story: About page with portfolio referral (WMDP2-71)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-21). `/about` with the case-study narrative and the outbound referral to the owner's portfolio site. See [WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md](WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md) section 1.18.
- ~~Story: Unity demo referral card on the About page (WMDP2-75)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-22, commit f177b75). The milestone-gated referral decision executed: a "Related experiment" card on `/about` (honest ~30 MB / desktop-recommended labeling, href-pinned by test) rather than a nav-level button — promotion to prominent placement is gated on the Inspection Round scenario landing (WMDP2-74).
- ~~Story: Related sites by project (WMDP2-65)~~ — **Done, on the board** (transitioned in the same sitting the feature shipped). A `?project=` filter on `/api/sites` powers the detail page's related-sites section, the dashboard's project links, and project-scoped exports — see WA_MINING_PROJECT_PLAN.md section 1.14. With WMDP2-17 also Done, **Sprint 3's scope is now fully complete** — and the sprint was closed on 2026-07-20 (see the sync log).

**Epic: Unity Simulation Showcase** (WMDP2-72, In Progress — created on the board 2026-07-22)

The C#/Unity track (Viewport XR-aligned simulation showcase + freelance portfolio piece). Requirements discovery, the validated 5W1H, and the approved feature spec live on branch `feature/unity-shift-supervisor-v2` (`prototypes/unity-shift-supervisor-demo/DISCOVERY.md` and `FEATURE_INSPECTION_ROUND.md`); the epic's description carries the branch discipline (main only receives milestone-quality merges) and the 2–3 h/week capacity.
- ~~Story: Ship the link: WebGL build published at a shareable URL (WMDP2-73)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-22). Unity 6 headless WebGL build (32 MB, 0 errors, built by the committed `WebGLBuildScript.cs`) live at **https://wa-mining-unity.netlify.app** on its own dedicated Netlify site; verified in production with Playwright (scene render + marker click → correct MINEDEX record); cross-linked from the prototype README (with the build/deploy runbook) and the root README's Related Experiments. The editor-pin reversal (2022.3 → Unity 6) and the four-failure module-install saga are documented in the prototype's DECISIONS.md and TROUBLESHOOTING_LOG.md #3.
- ~~Story: Inspection Round scenario — increments I1+I2 (WMDP2-74)~~ — **Done, on the board** (2026-07-24; spec approved 2026-07-22). I1 (`dc09417`): pure-C# `InspectionRound` core, 23 EditMode tests green headless. I2 (`612e2bd`, `d7a1c93`, `973fce6`): the playable loop — briefing, two-step flag decisions with reasons, progress HUD, end-of-shift report with the caught/missed verdict, restart — generated and wired by the committed idempotent `ScenarioUiBuilder`, with the orbit-camera click-through bug fixed via an EventSystem pointer guard. Verified with a full-loop Playwright click-through of the built WebGL output, then redeployed to **wa-mining-unity.netlify.app** (production spot-check green). The spec's I2 milestone merge landed the same sitting: owner approved at the gate, merged to main as `e8dfe95` (no-ff), CI green.

## Board sync log (2026-08-16b) — AWS direction change

The AWS work is being restarted around **showing architecture rather than showing presence**, using the SAA-C03 material. `DEPLOYMENT.md`'s single-EC2 + docker-compose runbook is complete and still valid, and it stays in the repo — but one instance running containers exercises none of the exam's four domains, so it is the wrong vehicle for this particular goal.

Three blocks were scoped; **block A** (edge delivery) is built and committed as `infra/` in `520e6b1`, unapplied. Block C (S3 + Glue + Athena over the MINEDEX data — cheap, and the differentiator for a data project) and block B (Lambda + API Gateway + Postgres in private subnets) follow, in that order, because B carries all the cost risk.

**The load-bearing design decision** is that the CloudFront distribution has two origins: the bucket, and the API. The browser only ever talks to the CloudFront domain, so there is no cross-origin request and **no CORS configuration anywhere** — which works without touching application code, because `client.ts` already falls back to `window.location.origin`. Today `/api/*` proxies to the live Netlify deployment, so block A delivers the whole working app rather than a static shell; when the Lambda tier lands, one Terraform variable changes and the frontend never knows.

**No ALB and no NAT Gateway anywhere, deliberately** — roughly $16 and $32 a month, billed hourly whether used or not, neither in the free tier, and between them the usual source of a surprise portfolio bill.

Board changes executed this sitting:

- **WMDP2-18 re-scoped** from "Provision AWS infrastructure" (EC2, security group, Docker) to **"Provision the AWS edge stack with Terraform (S3 + CloudFront + budget)"**. New description and a comment carrying the reasoning. Stays flagged and To Do — the blocker moved from "no AWS credentials" to "no AWS account".
- **WMDP2-19 re-scoped** from "Deploy and verify on EC2" to **"Deploy the frontend to CloudFront and verify the API seam"**, with four named acceptance checks. The `?sort=bogus` one matters most: it fails if the SPA-rewrite function was attached to the wrong behaviour and is silently turning API 422s into the app shell with status 200 — a distribution that looks perfectly healthy while quietly breaking error handling.
- **Both keep their story numbers and their place under AWS Cloud Deployment.** Renumbering would have thrown away the July history, including the blocked-on-credentials trail.
- **Subtasks WMDP2-36/37/38 deliberately untouched.** 36 (Free Tier eligibility, budget alert) is still valid and arguably more central now. 37 (launch EC2) and 38 (install Docker) are superseded and describe work that will not happen. Closing them as won't-do or re-scoping them to the apply/verify steps is an owner call; deleting board history unilaterally is not.

Netlify stays live throughout — this is a second deployment, not a migration.

## Board sync log (2026-08-16)

**WMDP2-77 → Done.** The `INITCAP` conjunction defect is fixed and pushed: `a93a40b` (the coupled SQL + data + code fix), `eb50b31` (docs retiring the defect they had recorded as open), `4adbba2` (a stale-lockfile fix in the `unity-webgl-release` skill, found while verifying). CI green on all four jobs. Closing comment on the story carries the verification and the two decisions worth keeping — the additive Netlify migration, and the deliberate refusal to concern-split a change whose intermediate states would each have been silently wrong.

Also recorded on the story, and still unstoried: **`lga_name` carries the same class of defect from a different mechanism** — 65 distinct values reading `City Of Albany` / `Shire Of Broome`, produced by the hardcoded `'Shire Of ' || ...` literals in `SQL/03`'s `CASE` block rather than by `INITCAP`. Left out of WMDP2-77 rather than quietly widening its scope; it would touch the map, the filters and the detail pages.

Board shape after this sitting: Sprint 4 still empty and completable; backlog holds WMDP2-18, 19, 20, 24 and 76, with 77 now Done under WMDP2-59.

## Board sync spec (2026-08-04) — EXECUTED 2026-08-09

Written on 2026-08-04 as an executable spec because that review sitting had no authenticated Jira session and mutated nothing; the board and this file were left deliberately, visibly disagreeing on Sprint 4 rather than silently. **Executed in full on 2026-08-09**, five days later. Outcome against each item is recorded inline below.

Two facts the spec asked to carry into board comments had gone stale in those five days and were corrected before posting rather than repeated — see the struck-through bullets at the end of this section. That is the lesson worth keeping: an executable spec ages, so re-verify its repo-side claims at execution time, not at authoring time.

Result on the board: Sprint 4 now reads "There's nothing in this sprint" (0 work items) and the backlog holds six — WMDP2-18, 19, 20, 24, 76 and the newly created 77.

To execute:

- **Remove WMDP2-76 and WMDP2-20 from Sprint 4**, back to the backlog, each with a comment citing `DISCOVERY.md`'s WHEN section: *"its Sprint 4 (contract tests + custom domain) yields priority and moves behind this"* (written 2026-07-21, two days before the sprint was started with that scope anyway). The sprint then closes empty rather than 0/2 — an honest "this sprint was overtaken by the Unity track" instead of a velocity collapse the sprint report cannot explain. Same principle that refused the Sprint 3 back-fill (2026-07-21 log) and the Sprint 4 pre-fill (2026-07-20 log): the report must not imply something that did not happen.
- **Comment on WMDP2-76** recording that its cheap half shipped on 2026-08-04 outside the sprint — a root typecheck over `netlify/` + `db/` in CI, plus the two real drifts it existed to catch (CSV formula-cell neutralization and the `/api` `no-store` header, both missing from the deployed port; see plan 1.20). Remaining scope is the differential HTTP contract test against `netlify dev`. **Do not close it** — the behavioural half is the story.
- **WMDP2-72 (Unity epic)** stays In Progress. Add a comment that Horizon 1 ended 2026-08-03 (the Viewport XR start date) and that I3/I4 are the open increments — plus the branch fact below, which is the trap waiting for whoever starts I3.
- **WMDP2-18/19** — untouched, still flagged, still genuinely blocked on AWS credentials.
- **DONE — created as WMDP2-77** ("Fix the `INITCAP` conjunction defect in `SQL/03` and re-propagate the corrected stage value"), Story under WMDP2-59 Product Polish, assigned, To Do, with the blast radius and acceptance criteria in its description. The spec's original wording follows. **Consider a new story for the `INITCAP` conjunction defect** (plan section 3, found in the 2026-08-04 review): `SQL/03` turns the raw export's correct `Care and Maintenance` into `Care And Maintenance`. Small change, wide blast radius — SQL rule, pipeline re-run, regenerated cleaned CSV, re-seed of both databases including the Netlify migration, plus the Unity constants and their tests. Sized as its own story rather than a cleanup bullet; parent WMDP2-59 Product Polish.

Repo-side facts this sync should carry into the board's comments:

- ~~`feature/unity-shift-supervisor-v2` is **fully merged and 12 commits behind `main`**~~ — **stale as of 2026-08-08; do not carry this into a board comment.** The branch has since been fast-forwarded and now points at the same commit as `main` (`1150248`; `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...origin/feature/unity-shift-supervisor-v2` → `0 0`). `CLAUDE.md`, the staged-codepoint hook, the `.gitattributes` LF pin and the `unity-webgl-release` skill are all present on it, so the trap this bullet recorded — starting I3 on a tip that predates the tooling — no longer exists. The Unity-epic comment should state the branch is current.
- ~~`agent-localhost-to-project-domain-c90c` is fully merged too (0 ahead, 29 behind) — the dead PR #2 branch, still on origin.~~ — **also stale**: the branch was deleted from origin, confirmed 2026-08-08 by `git ls-remote --heads origin`, which now returns only `main` and the feature branch. Nothing left to clean up.

*(Both bullets above were written 2026-08-04 and were true then. They are struck through rather than deleted because the spec is an executable document: a later session that ran it verbatim would have posted two false statements to the board. Re-verify repo-side facts at execution time, not at authoring time — that is the general lesson, and it is why the correction stays visible.)*

## Board sync log (2026-07-24)

Same sitting as the 2026-07-23 log, past midnight — increment I2 shipped and the story closed:
- **WMDP2-74 → Done** with a closing comment carrying the full I1+I2 recap, the four branch commits, the live URL, and the open merge-gate question. The I2 work behind it: the playable inspection-round loop built by the committed `ScenarioUiBuilder`, the orbit-camera click-through fix, EditMode suite still 23/23, full-loop Playwright verification of the built WebGL output, and the redeploy to wa-mining-unity.netlify.app (production spot-check green).
- Sprint 4's own stories (WMDP2-76, WMDP2-20) deliberately untouched — the Unity track runs beside the sprint.
- **I2 milestone merge executed**: owner approved at the gate, `feature/unity-shift-supervisor-v2` merged to main as `e8dfe95` (no-ff, six branch commits preserved), CI green. The branch stays alive for I3/I4.

## Board sync log (2026-07-23)

Sprint 4 executed and the Unity increment started, same sitting:
- **WMDP2-76 "Contract-test the Netlify Functions against the FastAPI reference"** created — Story, parent WMDP2-5, assigned, full differential-testing scope in the description — and placed into Sprint 4.
- **WMDP2-20** placed into Sprint 4 (its re-scoped custom-domain-only remit stands).
- **Sprint 4 started** (2026-07-23 → 16 Aug, goal recorded in Jira): exactly the two stories the owner picked on 2026-07-21, nothing back-filled.
- **WMDP2-74 → In Progress** as Inspection Round increment I1 shipped on the branch (`dc09417`: pure-C# scenario core + 23 EditMode tests, all green headless). I2 (the playable loop UI) is the story's remaining scope.

## Board sync log (2026-07-22)

The Unity track materialized on the board, all verified by page reads after each mutation:
- **WMDP2-72 "Unity Simulation Showcase"** — epic created via the Create dialog (work type corrected from the dialog's retained "Epic→Story" state... the dialog retains the last-used type; verify it every time), set In Progress, assigned, described.
- **WMDP2-73** — created as the Option 1 story ("Ship the link"), In Progress during the build/publish work, **Done** with a closing comment carrying the live URL, build facts, and doc pointers.
- **WMDP2-74** — created under the epic with the approved spec scope in its description, assigned, left **To Do** deliberately.
- **WMDP2-75** — created under Product Polish for the About-page referral card, **Done** (the work shipped in the same sitting, commit f177b75).
- Repair: **WMDP2-5's assignee restored** (an earlier stray-keystroke mishap had unassigned it).
- Process note, again for the record: Jira's single-key shortcuts (c = create, i = assign-toggle, m = comment) fire whenever a click misses its input target — this sitting they briefly unassigned WMDP2-72 and WMDP2-75 and opened stray Create dialogs, all caught by the click→screenshot-verify→type protocol and repaired within the minute. Treat every type-after-click on this board as unverified until a screenshot proves focus.

## Board sync log (2026-07-21)

The 2026-07-21 pending-sync spec this section previously held, executed once Chrome reconnected. A deliberate decision first: the About page and Netlify deployment were **not** added to the completed Sprint 3, even though 21 Jul falls inside its original 19 Jul–2 Aug window — the sprint closed on 20 Jul with 100% of its scope done, and reopening a completed sprint to back-fill it would corrupt the sprint report the same way pre-filling Sprint 4 would fake velocity. Done-in-backlog remains the truthful record (owner approved this reasoning before execution).

Created and transitioned:
- **WMDP2-70** — "Netlify production deployment + agent-PR postmortem" — Story, parent **WMDP2-4 AWS Cloud Deployment**, no sprint, **Done**, description linking plan 1.19. (Created via the epic page's inline child row, which sidesteps the Create dialog's retained-fields trap — but its type selector defaults to Task and the first Story click didn't register; the type was corrected on the item afterward. Verify the type icon after inline creation.)
- **WMDP2-71** — "About page with portfolio referral" — Story, parent **WMDP2-59 Product Polish**, no sprint, **Done**, description linking plan 1.18.
- **WMDP2-21 Automated CD** — Done with explanatory comment (Netlify auto-builds `main`; EC2 CD would be new AWS-epic scope), and its missing epic link fixed to WMDP2-5.
- **WMDP2-20 TLS and custom domain** — scope-note comment added (TLS free via netlify.app; custom domain is the remaining half), stays To Do for Sprint 4 planning.
- **WMDP2-18/19** — untouched, still flagged: genuinely blocked on AWS credentials.

Drift discovered during the sync (recorded, not silently fixed):
- **The import never epic-linked 17/18/19/20/24** — WMDP2-4 "AWS Cloud Deployment" (In Progress) had zero children until WMDP2-70; the backlog rows' hierarchy icons belong to their subtasks, not epic links. This file's epic groupings described intent, not board reality.
- **WMDP2-5 auto-completed** on 2026-07-20 when WMDP2-69 closed (its only board children were 22/23/68/69, all Done). Re-parenting the open 20/24 under it would reopen it — a real option, but a Sprint 4 planning call, not a unilateral sync action.

## Board sync log (2026-07-20)

The sprint review's three stories, created on the board once Chrome was available (the "pending sync" spec this section previously held is now executed):
- **WMDP2-67** — "Code-review fixes: breakdown tie ordering + search wildcard escaping" — Done, parent WMDP2-59 Product Polish, placed **in Sprint 3** since the work happened inside the sprint's window (plan 1.15, C1+C2).
- **WMDP2-68** — "Data-refresh guardrails" — To Do, parent WMDP2-5 Post-Deployment Hardening, backlog (plan 2.1).
- **WMDP2-69** — "Platform hygiene: Node pin, U+FEFF CI guard, JSON cache headers" — To Do, parent WMDP2-5, backlog (plan 2.2).

Sprint 3 at that point held WMDP2-17, 65, 67 — all Done; the backlog held 18/19 (flagged, AWS-blocked), 20, 21, 24, 68, 69.

Later the same sitting (sprint close + the two hardening stories):
- **Sprint 3 completed** through the backlog's Complete-sprint flow — the dialog confirmed "3 completed work items. That's all of them." The offered Confluence retrospective was declined (ceremony without a team; this log and the plan file carry the retro content). Jira auto-created an empty **Sprint 4** (2 Aug – 16 Aug), left un-started while the deployment direction (free-tier live demo now vs. wait for AWS credentials) is an open decision.
- **WMDP2-68 Data-refresh guardrails**: To Do → In Progress when implementation started → **Done** once both suites passed (plan 1.16).
- **WMDP2-69 Platform hygiene**: same flow, same sitting → **Done** (plan 1.17).
- 68/69 were deliberately **not** dragged into the Sprint 4 shell: the work happened between sprints, and back-filling a future sprint with already-finished items would fake its velocity report. Done-in-backlog is the truthful record.

## Board reconciliation log (2026-07-19)

The board drifted while the repo shipped (every item above previously carried a "done, not yet reflected in the live Jira board" note). Reconciled in one pass, executed through the Jira UI:
- WMDP2-22 and WMDP2-23 transitioned to Done; Jira's built-in parent automation moved epic WMDP2-5 to In Progress on its own.
- Product Polish epic (WMDP2-59) created with five Done stories for the shipped-untracked features, plus WMDP2-65 (Related sites) into Sprint 3.
- The empty, never-started Sprint 1/2 shells were deleted (their stories WMDP2-6..16 keep their Done status; retro-dating fake sprint completions would have corrupted the record worse than absence does).
- WMDP2-18/19 moved from Sprint 3 to the backlog and flagged, so the active sprint no longer consists entirely of externally-blocked work.

## How this got into Jira

Via **System → External System Import → CSV** (`jira_backlog_import.csv`, same directory), using a `Work item Id` column to make Sub-task → Parent linking resolve reliably (Jira's CSV importer matches `Epic Link` against `Epic Name` by value directly, but `Parent` needs real ID references within the same file, not text matching). Sprint assignment was done as a separate bulk-edit pass afterward, since the importer doesn't create new sprints from a CSV's `Sprint` column values.

If re-running this CSV against a fresh project: watch for the "Import Work items" step reporting near-complete (e.g. 59%) faster than it's actually finished — the Sub-task rows can process on a slower deferred path and land 15-20 minutes later, which reads as stalled but isn't. Wait for it to fully finish before manually recreating anything, or you'll get duplicates.
